nohup fastq-dump --split-files SRR1694055.sra &

# will split to two file in case we have pair-ends in our case we have only single reads

nohup fastq-dump SRR1694055.sra &

head SRR1694055.fastq

to align the srrxxx.fastq gile to the reference genome we need to create index from http://useast.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/Info/Index 

Download genes, cDNAs, ncRNA, proteins (FASTA) and download from directory cdna file Mus_musculus.GRCm38.cdna.all.fa.gz

unzip the file and built index using bowtie2
bowtie2-build Mus_musculus.GRCm38.cdna.all.fasta mus/mus

very important if you change the name to mus you should also change the name of fasta file  to mus.fa and keep it in the same directory with index files. 

Transfer the fastq files to the same directory or use ABSOLUTE PATH to the files to align the fastq file(s)
bowtie2 -p 4 -x mus -U SRR1694055.fastq -S RAW.bt2.sam
 -U option for single reads 

samtools mpileup -v -u -f mus.fa raw.bt2_s.bam>raw.vcf #create vcf file from SORTED bam 

file

samtools mpileup -g -f mus.fa raw.bt2_s.bam>raw.bcf # create bcf file from SORTED bam file

download  htslib and bcftools to directory Vitaly from http://www.htslib.org/download/

then cd to Vitaly/bcftools and make

create PATH to executable files using next comand

Vitalys-iMac:bcftools Vitaly$ export PATH=/Users/Vitaly/bcftools:$PATH

using vi I edit ~?.bash_profile by inserting next line export PATH="/Users/Vitaly/bcftools:$PATH"
restart terminal and now bcftools work by default::
